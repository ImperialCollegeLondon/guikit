.. py:class:: ThreadResult(data, event_type)

   Bases: :py:obj:`wx.PyEvent`

   Simple event to carry arbitrary result data.


.. py:class:: WorkerThread(target, on_abort = None, on_complete = None, on_error = None, daemon = None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`threading.Thread`

   Worker Thread Class.

   .. py:method:: connect_events(window)

      Connect the complete, abort and error events to the functions to execute.

      :param window: The main window of the program.


   .. py:method:: run()

      Run worker thread and deals with the wrapping up accordingly.


   .. py:method:: on_abort(event)

      To execute when the thread execution is aborted.

      :param event: The event object with the relevant output data


   .. py:method:: on_complete(event)

      To execute when the thread execution is completed normally.

      :param event: The event object with the relevant output data


   .. py:method:: on_error(event)

      To execute when the thread ends with an error.

      :param event: The exception raised



.. py:class:: ThreadPool(window = None)

   .. py:attribute:: _instance
      :type: Optional[ThreadPool]

      

   .. py:method:: get_thread(ident)

      Get the worker thread referred to with ident in a thread-safe manner.

      :param ident: Thread identifier

      :raises KeyError: If the thread identifier is not in the ThreadPool


   .. py:method:: run_thread(target, on_abort = None, on_complete = None, on_error = None, daemon = None)

      Runs a new thread executing the target callable on it.

      The thread will run until:
          - The 'target' function returns
          - An exception is raised

      The target function might finish because it has completed what it was doing. In
      that case, 'on_complete' is executed after returning from `target`.

      It might also finish because it is monitoring the value of
      `ThreadPool().query_abort()` and this is `True`. In that case, target should
      return with an appropriate value and `on_abort` is then executed.

      Finally, an exception might occur in the thread. In this case, the exception
      is caught and `on_error` is executed.

      `on_complete`, `on_abort` and `on_error` are all executed in the main thread.

      :param target: The function to be executed in a separate thread.
      :param on_abort: The function to be executed when the target function is aborted.
                       Takes as input the value returned by target.
      :param on_complete: The function to be executed when the target function is
                          completed normally. Takes as input the value returned by target.
      :param on_error: The function to be executed when an exception is raised in the
                       target. Takes as input the exception raised.
      :param daemon: If the function is a daemonic function.

      :returns: The id number for the thread, needed if it is to be aborted externally.


   .. py:method:: query_abort()

      Check if the current thread is to be aborted.

      :raises KeyError: If the thread identifier is not in the ThreadPool


   .. py:method:: abort_thread(ident)

      Flag the thread with `ident` to be aborted.

      :param ident: Thread identifier

      :raises KeyError: If the thread identifier is not in the ThreadPool


   .. py:method:: join_thread(ident)

      Join the thread specified by `ident`.

      :param ident: Thread identifier

      :raises KeyError: If the thread identifier is not in the ThreadPool


   .. py:method:: post_event(event)

      Adds an event to the event loop of the main thread.


   .. py:method:: stop_threads()

      Stop all worker threads and wait for them to finish.

      .. todo::

         Leave daemon threads running?
         Race condition if a thread is created while this function is running



.. py:function:: run_thread(target, on_abort = None, on_complete = None, on_error = None, daemon = None)

   Is an alias for ThreadPool().run_thread(...).


.. py:function:: run_daemon(target, on_abort = None, on_complete = None, on_error = None)

   Is an alias for ThreadPool().run_thread(..., daemon=True).


.. py:function:: abort_thread(ident)

   Set thread with given identifier to abort.

   :param ident: Thread identifier


.. py:function:: should_abort()

   Return whether the thread with given identifier should abort or not.
